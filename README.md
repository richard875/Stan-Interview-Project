## Description

In this project, I have adhered closely to established guidelines by employing a range of technologies to develop a Single Page Application encompassing the `Home` and `Program` pages.

- I decided to use `React Router` because of its simplicity and ease of use. Leveraging this technology allowed me to quickly set up routes and navigate between pages.

- I used the `Styled Components` library to style the project. I like the idea of defining styles as components and using them in the Reach Virtual DOM.

- I learned and implemented the `Redux` library to manage the state of the application. This allows the code to be more organised and easier to maintain without passing props down the component tree.

## Setup Instructions

Please ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js v20
- npm v8
- Git

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

When you finish, you can run `npm run build` to create a production build, and `npm start` to start the production server.

## Tests

I have implemented `Jest` and `React Testing Library` to write tests for the components. You can run the tests by running `npm run test`.

## Commit History

You can view the commit history in the GitHub repository timeline.

## Improvements and Roadmap

- Add a `Search` feature to allow users to search for programs.
- More features to the application, such as a `Contact` page, `About` page, and `Blog` page.
- Implement a `User Authentication` system to allow users to sign up and log in.

## What would I do differently if I were allocated more time?

Testing, testing, testing! I would have written more tests to ensure the application is robust and reliable. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Feedback on Coding Challenge

I enjoyed working on this project. It was a great opportunity to utilise those technologies to demonstrate my skills. I look forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions for improvement. -Richard
